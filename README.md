# Custom alias plugin for lethal company

## Goal

To create a fully customisable alias system.

## How does it work?

Aliases are registered with a unique string, as shown in the default configuration below.  
```alias keyword : command``` This is the structure of an alias binding, and each alias binding is separated by a semicolon ```;```.

# To add you can use LethalConfig

## How to add/remove/edit?

Characters ```:``` and ```;``` are prohibited in alias/command. You can edit the configuration file by following this rule.  
To add an alias, insert ```your alias: your command``` into the configuration file.  
To delete an alias, remove the line containing the target alias and its associated command.  
Don't forget to separate your alias by a semicolon ```;```.
